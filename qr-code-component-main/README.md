## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google fonts

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Google fonts
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
```
```css
h2{
      font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
p{
      font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```
@import keyword css
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

I'd like to work more on css flex-box because it is a very powerful property i can use to develop my web development skills and i want to learn other properties related to the flex-box like css grid.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/1H-vSHVOxoU) - This helped me figure out out to centralize my web page. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
